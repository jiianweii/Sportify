## Summary

The Sportify application keeps track of the user’s activities and displays them in the dashboard for reference. To allow the application to run, the user must allow notification and location permission. Once the user clicks on the run, the application will get the user’s current location and display it on the map. Whenever the user moves, the application will get the updated location and display it with a polyline (red line) from the first to the current location to indicate where the user has run past.
There are three indicators that the user can take note of the distance, timer, and average pace. Apart from these indicators, there is also a built-in notification feature that will display on the notification bar on the device to notify the user about the current activity.
